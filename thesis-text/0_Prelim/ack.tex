Over the course of writing this thesis, I have received lots of support and assistance.\\
First of all I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Kia Teymourian, who guided me and helped me formulate the research question, provided me with sources and methodology. Your insightful feedback pushed me to sharpen my thought process and helped me elevate the quality of my work.\\
I would like to thank the administrative staff at MET college, especially Ronette Lyle and the BU ISSO team who helped me through the administrative process.
I would like to acknowledge my friends and colleagues at Boston University for their wonderful feedback and discussions.\\
In addition I would like to thank my parents and my brother for their wise counsel, an empathetic ear and for always being there for me.
