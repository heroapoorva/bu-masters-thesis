% ABSTRACT
Datastreams have become a commonplace scenario and they have become increasingly complex. With the network traffic volumes increasing doing meaningful calculations and inferring results from them is becoming increasingly challenging. With the recent increase in volumes of data streams a lot of focus is upon cloud infrastructure and scalability. The flexibility that the mathematical model of deep reinforcement learning and its wide variety of applications make it a promising approach. The continuous nature of data streams makes the conventional approach inapplicable due to reduced speed. The method applied and implemented is generic and applicable to a wide range of data streams. The goal of this study is to act as a proof of concept. The thesis explores the use of the method on a query from Linear road benchmark data. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in optimizing the query execution. We hope the work in this thesis encourages others to work on the development of a robust and generalized system, capable of optimizing any query on any data stream.
