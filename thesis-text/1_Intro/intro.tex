The next chapter gives an in-depth view of the pipeline used by the current state of art technology for query optimization in traditional data bases including the mathematical knowledge for simplification and the overall framework. The next chapter also introduces the reader to data stream and how data bases are used for them called DSMS and showcases an approach to optimize queries on data streams for the problem discusses above. The following chapter list out the details if implementation, challenges face, evaulation methods used, benchmark test case timings, followed by a summary of the paper.
