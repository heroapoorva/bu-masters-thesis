\section{Formal Problem statement}
To define a concrete problem statement, we will need to decide upon
\begin{itemize}
    \item The learning data, which will work as the input to our model, the data should be replicable so that model can be tested consistently.
    \item While more implementation based, the method to take input needs to be decided as well and maintained for consistancy reasons.
    \item After fixing the input data and method, for DSMS need to decide upon queries of sufficient complexity for the results to be interesting. Only by having sufficiently complex queries will the query graph lead to interesting results.
    \item At this point need to combine the knowledge from chapter 2 regarding querying processing to come up with a prediction model, its execution, training and evaluation.

\end{itemize}
