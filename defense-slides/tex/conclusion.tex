\begin{frame}{Overall accuracy}
    The model predicted optimal move correctly for $12978$ data points, out of $27681$, i.e. $47\%$.\\
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comparison}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The sum of number of operations required by the optimal ordering $890640075.0$
        \item The sum of number of operations required by the predicted ordering $900269878.0$
        \item The sum of number of operations required by the optimal ordering $2310227856.0$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Performance}
    Our model resulted in requiring $39\%$ of operations as the query execution would have required if it executed the worst ordering every time.\\
    Our model resulted in requiring $102\%$ of operations as the query execution would have required if it executed the optimal ordering every time.\\
