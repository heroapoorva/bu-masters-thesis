    \begin{itemize}
        \item The neural network is unable to achieve low loss for the test data, this perhaps speak the lack of features extracted during the querying time.
        \item The data sample we have is highly biased, leading to rather baised DQNs.
        \item The entire method needs to be parallelized and set up on a scalable infrastructure to see the actual effects of DQN.
        \item The DQN used is simulating a single move game rather than a multi move game.
        \item Not looked at how DQNs can be trained online.
